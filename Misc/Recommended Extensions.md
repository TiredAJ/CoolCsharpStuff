Some *AJ endorsed* extensions I make good use of.

# `C# Inline color Visualizer`
- -   Matt Lacey [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MattLaceyLtd.CSInlineColorViz)
Just shows a little box next to colours to show you what it looks like:

# `Collapse Level`
-   Mwilski [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mwilski.CollapseLevel)
Adds very handy keybindings for folding (and unfolding) code.

# `Indent Rainbow`
-   Marcel Wagner [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chingucoding.IndentRainbow)
Adds some colour to indents to show indent levels.

# `Make The Sound`
-   djfoxer [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=djfoxer.MakeTheSound)
Easily one of my favourites. It adds sounds to different events, like a floppy disk sound effect when saving and a cartoon arrow hitting a target when a breakpoint is hit.

# `Rainbow Braces`
-   Mads Kristen [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.RainbowBraces)  
Similar to Indent Rainbow, Rainbow Braces colours brace pairs different to help identify their scope.

# `Select Next Occurrence`
-   Thomas Welén [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thomaswelen.SelectNextOccurrence64bit)
Easily my favourite. I have `SelectNextExactOccurrence.SelectNextExactOccurrence` bound to `alt+D` and I just can’t go back. I’ve struggled using MS Word because I keep clicking `alt+D` and it doesn’t do anything. Using the keybind you’ve set, it’ll add another caret (cursor) at the next exact selection. Sometimes (most times) it’s just quicker and easier to use than `ctrl+F` and replacing.

# Viasfora
-   Tomas Restrepo [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomasRestrepo.Viasfora)
General colouriser that adds a bunch of colouring and highlighting. My brain has rewired itself to recognise C# code in its default colours. I struggle so much reading C# code in any other colour set (like the default colours of Obsidian's code blocks). The colours used in the screenshots are due to this extension.

# File Icons
-   Mads Kristen [Here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.FileIcons)
Very handy QoL extension that adds icons for more document types in the Solution Explorer.
